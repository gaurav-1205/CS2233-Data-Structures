# Data Structures

Here are some of the Data structures I learnt from the course CS2233 offered by the department of Computer Science, IIT Hyderabad


### 1. Binary Search Tree
A binary Search Tree which can take input for adding, deleting, finding successor, searching, printing pre-order traversal, finding children, uncle and Left/Right rotating a node.
The Program can handle numbers of arbitrary size.

### 2. Red Black Trees
Red black trees are self balancing Binary Search Trees. The program can serve requests like adding, deleting, finding successor, searching, printing pre-order traversal, finding children, etc.
The program can handle numbers of arbitrary size.

### 2. Undirected Unweighted Graph | BFS
A graph which takes inputs of the vertices and edges and serves requests like checking if an edge exists between 2 vertices, Breadth-First-Search(BFS) from the given vertex and the shortest path between 2 vertices.
I have used adjacency list for building the graphs.

### 3. Directed Weighted Graph | Dijkstra's Algorithm
A graph which takes inputs of the vertices and edges and serves requests like checking if an edge exists between 2 vertices, printing the value of weight if edge exists, Dijkstra's Algorithm on the given vertex and the shortest path between 2 vertices.
I have used adjacency list for building the graphs.

### 4. Sets 
Building singleton sets of the given number and then serve requests like performing union on given sets, checking if the elements belong to the same set, printing the representative element of the set containing the vertex, printing the rank of a set.
